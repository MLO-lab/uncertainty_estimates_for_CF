# FCL: Federated Continual Learning

### Done
1. Data loading, splitting and saving.
2. Memory management (random sampling, uncertainty sampling, reservoir update).
3. Classifiers (MLP, ResNet18)
4. CL training procedure.
5. Client-based data splitting (MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100).
6. FCL training procedure.
7. Step-sized memory sampling.
8. Class-balanced memory update.

### To-do (federated learning extension)
1. Implement other memory management strategies.
